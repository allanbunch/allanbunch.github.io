# Neuromorphic AI Inference: Enhancing Reasoning Through Human Neural Signal Modeling

## Abstract

Neuromorphic AI Inference explores enhancing AI reasoning by modeling input patterns based on human neural signal spikes. This paper introduces the Mixture of Model Outputs (MoMO) approach, where multiple AI models simulate distinct brain regions, producing outputs that are aggregated to form coherent responses. Initial findings suggest that this neuromorphic approach can significantly improve the coherence and reliability of AI inferences.

## Introduction

Traditional AI inference methods often lack the nuanced reasoning capabilities observed in human cognition. By modeling AI input patterns based on human neural signal spikes, I aim to bridge this gap. This paper presents my exploration of the MoMO approach, detailing its methodology, implementation, and potential benefits for AI development.

## The Origin of MoMO

MoMO is inspired by neuromorphic computing, aiming to mimic the brain's processing functionality. The idea of using a diverse set of AI models, each specializing in different contexts, aligns with how the human brain processes information. My development process and initial motivations were influenced by the need for more coherent and reliable AI inferences, leveraging principles from neuromorphic computing and ensemble model training.

## Methodology

Using the MoMO approach, I configured multiple AI models to emulate specific brain regions, each processing the same input in parallel. The aggregated outputs were then synthesized to form a final response. I implemented this approach in both Node-RED and Python, leveraging the OpenAI API for model inferences.

### Node-RED Implementation

The Node-RED implementation involves a fan-out/fan-in model. User queries are distributed among various AI models, each uniquely configured for specific conditions. These models respond asynchronously, and their responses are aggregated to form the input for a final inferencing model.

### Python API Example

A Python implementation using the OpenAI API showcases the MoMO approach with 5 brain region models, demonstrating the method's flexibility and effectiveness.

```python
import os
import asyncio

from typing import Dict

from openai import AsyncOpenAI

# Reference your OpenAI API key environment variable
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "")

# Define the session's system context
FINAL_SYSTEM_MESSAGE = "Channel a thoughtful human sharing their final thought with a friend using a cohesive, conversational, and casual tone, as derived from your **thought catalyst** and your various **brain region responses**."

# Define the session's input message
INPUT_MESSAGE = "What's the hydration percentage of my Neapolitan pizza dough recipe that's described in baker's percentages: 907 grams flour; 508 grams water; 25 grams salt; 10 percent sourdough starter maintained @ 100% hydration as the yeast"

aclient = AsyncOpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

# Define brain regions and their specific configurations
brain_regions = {

                },

            ],
            temperature=config["temperature"],
        )
        return {region: response.choices[0].message.content}
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in {region} inference: {e}")
        return {region: "Error during inference"}

    ]

    return {k: v for d in results for k, v in d.items()}

    try:

                },
            ],

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in final inference: {e}")
        return "Error during final inference"


async def main():
    input_message = INPUT_MESSAGE
    responses = await get_momo_inferences(input_message)

    # Aggregate the responses
    aggregated_message = "\n".join(
        [f"ðŸ§  {region}: {response}\n\n" for region, response in responses.items()]
    )

    # Perform final inference
    final_response = await final_inference(input_message, aggregated_message)
    print(f"Aggregated Responses:\n\n{aggregated_message}")
    print(f"ðŸ’¬ Final Response:\n\n{final_response}")


# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Experiments and Results

My experiments involved various input scenarios, comparing the responses generated by the neuromorphic approach with those from traditional methods. The results showed improved coherence, accuracty, and relevance, demonstrating the effectiveness of modeling AI inferences on human neural signal patterns.

## Model Mixture Selection

MoMO can leverage diverse models, including proprietary hosted models and local models, chosen based on domain knowledge, fine-tuning topics, training parameter size, and operational cost. A combination of open-source and proprietary models is used depending on project needs.

## Discussion

While the neuromorphic approach shows promise, continued research should focus on optimizing model and brain region selection for even more nuanced AI reasoning.

## What's Next for MoMO

A significant future development in MoMO is the implementation of dynamic model output weighting. I plan to use AI to categorize input stimuli and adjust the influence of each federated model's output based on its target domain, ensuring flexibility and relevance without imposing strict constraints.

## Conclusion

This research highlights the potential of neuromorphic AI inference to enhance the reasoning capabilities of AI systems. By modeling human neural signal spikes, I can achieve more coherent and reliable outputs, paving the way for more advanced and human-like AI interactions.
